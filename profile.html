            <p>In my spare time I enjoy developing film, and fishing. </p>
            <ol>Here are a few steps involved in the film developing process:<br>
                <li>
                    Load the film negatives from the film canister to the developing tank (in my case I use a paterson tank and a changing bag to reduce the need for a darkroom
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Process the film negatives inside the tank, via a mixture of chemicals around 95&#176;-105&#176;
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Transfer the film to a clean, cool area to dry. Try to avoid areas with high traffic to minimize any dust settling on the film.
